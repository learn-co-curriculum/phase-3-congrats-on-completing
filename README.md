# Congratulations on Completing Phase 3!

Congratulations on finishing Phase 3 of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program! In this phase, you moved beyond your frontend expertise by learning Ruby. You should now be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Ruby as a language, including principles of object oriented programming
- Understand the characteristics of a relational database
- Use Ruby to interact with a SQL database
- Perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) actions with a database via an Object-Relational Mapper
- Design an API to handle CRUD actions
- Communicate with an API using different HTTP verbs

With your new knowledge of Ruby and how to persist data to a backend database, you now have all the tools necessary to be a full-stack developer!
